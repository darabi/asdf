git subtree
-----------

git subtree is a contribution to git which is part of the contrib
packages of git starting with version 1.7.11.

Quoting from its man page [1]:

Subtrees allow subprojects to be included within a subdirectory
of the main project, optionally including the subproject's
entire history.

For example, you could include the source code for a library
as a subdirectory of your application.

Subtrees are not to be confused with submodules, which are meant for
the same task. Unlike submodules, subtrees do not need any special
constructions (like .gitmodule files or gitlinks) be present in
your repository, and do not force end-users of your
repository to do anything special or to understand how subtrees
work. A subtree is just a subdirectory that can be
committed to, branched, and merged along with your project in
any way you want.
